# Rogue-Waves-CofC-UCF-Project
This repository contains notes and exercises in regards to a UCF and CofC partnered project on rogue waves. All files are created in Python heavily using Matplotlib, scipy, and numpy. The subsequent files within can range from assorted numerical exercises in textbooks, pseudo code and reference code to build and put into larger projects. Any questions to ellisorl@g.cofc.edu. 

In the event the ipynb file does not load, you can go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy and paste the link to the file there and the modules will be pulled up. Git doesn't support the visuals for certiain modules (e.g. the sliders) and this website acts independently of git and provides a way to view the notebooks without having to download the notebook.
